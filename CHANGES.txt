NEW IN VERSION 2
===============================================================================
- CUDA code has been optimized significantly.

- Default inputs for all version now use 128 energy groups (rather than the
  prior 100 energy groups). This is done as 128 is a multiple of 32, making
  for more efficient use of SIMD vectors. This is an acceptable change because
  a moderate increase in energy groups increases the fidelity of a real world
  calculation and would not cost an unnecessarily large increase in wall time
  given the potential gains in SIMD vector efficiency.

- Some documentation has been cleaned up.

- Added the option in the CUDA code to vary the number of segments per CUDA
  block. This can be used to test the most efficient configuration for a 
  particular system. This option is altered using the "-p" command line option
  on the CUDA version (defaults to 100).

===============================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 1
===============================================================================
- The code has been ported to CUDA. The repository is now split up into two
  source folders - "cpu" and "cuda", which contain the CPU/Phi optimized code
  and GPU CUDA code respectively.

- A flat branch of the repo is also available. This branch has more GPU
  friendly data structures that should make the repo easier to port to
  accelerator languages such as OCCA or OpenACC.
