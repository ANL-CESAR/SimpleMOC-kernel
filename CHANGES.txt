NEW IN VERSION 1
===============================================================================
- The code has been ported to CUDA. The repository is now split up into two
  source folders - "cpu" and "cuda", which contain the CPU/Phi optimized code
  and GPU CUDA code respectively.

- A flat branch of the repo is also available. This branch has more GPU
  friendly data structures that should make the repo easier to port to
  accelerator languages such as OCCA or OpenACC.
